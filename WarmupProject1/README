==================================
	Warmup Project #1
==================================

==================================
	Design Decisions
==================================

+ 	For this project we were supposed to create a server that can handle multiple requests in parallel.
	Thus the server in this project is multi threaded. For this I made use of the POSIX Threads.

+	The client and the server are implemented as per the specifications. For message sending the client and the server
	use a buffer in which the data to be sent is copied. This buffer is then sent one byte at a time to the server.
	
+	If the client gets a reply that is greater than 512 bytes then it will print the all the data received from the server
	even though the response is incorrect and will print a message saying "Response received is Incorrect".
	
+	If the server receives a client request that has the request data > 256 bytes then it accepts the entire data but 
	does not process it and sends a ALL_FAIL response to the client.

==================================
	List of Files
==================================

+	server.h	-	header file for the server
+	server.c	- 	server code
+	client.h	-	header file for the client
+ 	client.c	-	client code
+	messageFunctions.h	-	header file for the common functions for client and server
+	messageFunctions.c	- 	file that has some common functions that both client and server use
+	Makefile	-	makefile for the project
+	README	-	document specifying details of the project

==================================
	Compiling the code
==================================

+	Compile the entire code for client, messageFunctions and server
	make
+	Compile the code for client and messageFunctions
	make client
+	Compile the code for server and messageFunctions
	make server
+	Remove all the executables and .o files
	make clean

==================================
	Known Bugs
==================================

+	There are no known bugs. The client and the server work correctly for all the tests specified in the grading guidelines.
