#	Project DESIGN
#==============================================#==============================================#==============================================

Project Design-1:
	
	
	This is how blocks have been designed at each node:
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
					       ____________________
	 				       |                  |
					       |   Message Cache  |

	 >>>>>>	____|--> Reader-3 -/ 				        \---> |_____ --->>> Writer 3
									


         ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+ Project has been designed in c as well as c++ programming constructs.
+ mutex and condition varialbe have been used to provide exclusive access of the queue to server and customers.
+ POSIX Threads have been used to implement multi-threading.
+ All test cases have been verified and checked before submission and were executed successfully without any known issues.
+ Nounexpected long blocking of the program or race conditions have been experienced in the project implementation.
+ read and write of data at beacons and non-beacons have been implemented byte-by-byte, i.e. only one byte is sent and one byte is received.
Character Stream implementation has been done.
      
Other Key Points:
- All the Design Specifications given in the Project Spec have been followed in the implementation.
- pthreads are used in server module to handle the requests from multiple servers.
- To avoid race conditions, pthread mutex and signals are used on large scale in the project implementation to share variables between threads at a node.
- Signal handling has been done for SIGINT, SIGUSR1 and SIGPIPE to handle signals in the program execution.
- If entry is not found in the INI file, then the program uses the default values.
- malloc is used to allocate dynamic memory.
- C++ STL libraries MAP, QUEUE have been used on large scale for all the implementation of queues to store, receive and send data accross the network
formed between the nodes.
- STL MAP is used to maintain a MESSAGE CACHE in the program implementation using UOID as a key.

#	KNOWN BUGS
#==============================================#==============================================#==============================================

- There are no known bugs in the implementation of the project, all the logic has been tested for all possible cases mentioned on grading guidelines.
*NOTE: 
	1. Nunki is a real time operating system, so sometimes the sleep used by the program for some logical behaviour is not experienced for the same amount of time and so it may lead to variations in the output.
	2. malloc and free is used in the project to allocate memory space and free the memory, sometimes malloc does not return the amount of memory.
		This may lead to segmentation Fault.
	3. Please include following lines to systemDataStructures.h in case of tests not running/ not giving expected output.

	#define DEBUGGING_MEMORY_CORRUPTION
    	#ifdef DEBUGGING_MEMORY_CORRUPTION
    	#ifdef free
    	#undef free
   	#endif
    	#define free
    	#endif

- All the provided grading guidelines were tested with the execution of the project and the output received was successfully compared with the expected output
provided in the guidelines.

#==============================================#==============================================#==============================================
#	DEVIATION FROM Spec
#==============================================#==============================================#==============================================
Specs mentioned in the Project WebPage and comments provided by professor during class and via mail as well as information mentioned in presentation have been followed for project's implementation. There is no deviation from the logical requirement of the system in the specs.

#==============================================#==============================================#==============================================
#	<RESPONSIBILITIES OF MEMBERS>
#==============================================#==============================================#==============================================
Design of the project was done before starting coding, so that both the members are on the same road.
+ Aniket: Designed + Coded Message Handling Section to be sent and received, Queuing of Messages for Beacons, Beacon Timer, Message Caching at Beacon, Beacon 		    Dispatcher.

+ Abhishek: Designed and implemented INI Parsing program, Non Beacon Timer, Non Beacon Startup + code for initial participation into network, 
		Beacon Starup Code,
